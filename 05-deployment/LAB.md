# Lab 5: Extend your portfolio, Responsive web design 

## Assignment 1: Extend your portfolio

### Overview

You will be adding new features to the portfolio project from lab 4. Work in the same repository on a new branch, remembering to add, commit, and push regularly.

When you have completed all of your features, make sure that your deployed application reflects the changes. On Canvas, submit a link to the last pull request from your branch to your master branch.

### Time Estimate

For each of the features listed below, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

```
Number and name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____
```

Add this information to your README.

### User Acceptance Tests

### Feature #1: Add functionality

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the developer's projects and skills stand out.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Complete the following features:
  - Use CDNs for content from libraries and remove the source code files from the project, as applicable
  - In tablet view, show a fixed navigation menu instead of a hamburger menu
  - Convert the large image at the top of your portfolio to a video background or an image carousel containing at least three images
  - Add any other UI features that you feel will make your portfolio unique and personalized

## Assignment 2: Responsive web design

### Overview

In lab 1, you built a web page where each box of content was rendered with a unique color in desktop view and in mobile view. You will be completing this assignment again, using either Flexbox or CSS grids for styling.

Refer back to the lab 1 assignment details for a reminder of the problem domain.

### Feature #1: Responsive design

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile device  
When the user changes the size of the viewport  
Then the boxes should scale proportionally and change colors  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
- Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
- Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.

## Submission Instructions

Note that there are two portions to today's lab: extending the features on your personal portfolio and completing the resposive web design assignment. Follow the submission instructions for each assignment and submit links to your pull requests in the corresponding Canvas assignments.

- Complete your Feature Tasks for the day
- Create a Pull Request (PR) back to the `master` branch of your repository
- On Canvas, submit a link to your PR and a link to your deployed application on Heroku. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
  - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
  - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
